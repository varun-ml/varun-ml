### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am interested in building projects using machine learning, and I have a particular interest in generative AI models, natural language processing, search, and personalization. 

- I have built Jupyter and Colab notebooks that demonstrate the use of diffusion models to generate numbers and characters based on the EMNIST dataset -- [Diffusion Models]

Currently, I am the Head of AI at [Needl.ai](https://www.needl.ai/). Building SOTA RAG platform for QA using LLM's, and other information retreival systems.

Thank you for your interest in my work. I look forward to sharing more in the future.
