### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am interested in building projects using machine learning, and I have a particular interest in generative AI models, natural language processing, search, and personalization. 

- I have built Jupyter and Colab notebooks that demonstrate the use of diffusion models to generate numbers and characters based on the EMNIST dataset -- [Diffusion Models]
- In the future, I plan to create a GitHub repository with useful neural network modules, starting with transformers for natural language processing and computer vision.

Currently, I am learning about variational autoencoders and their applications to topic modeling and natural language processing. I have also recently started using JAX, Haiku, and Optax for deep learning.

Thank you for your interest in my work. I look forward to sharing more in the future.
