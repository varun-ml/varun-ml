### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I like to build projects using Machine Learning! Insterested in generative AI models, NLP, Search and Personalization

- I have built notebooks(Jupyter/colab) meant to be instructive on using diffusion models to generate Numbers and characters based off EMNIST -- [Diffusion Models]
- Working on setting up a personal blog :)
- Will setup a github repo with useful NN modules, starting with Transformers for NLP and Vision
- Iâ€™m currently learning VAE's and applications to Topic models and NLP
