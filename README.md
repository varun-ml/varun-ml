### Hi there 👋

#### I’m Varun — building AI projects at the intersection of generative models, search, and finance.

* I’ve built tutorials on diffusion models with Jupyter and Colab, showing how they generate numbers and characters using the EMNIST dataset — [Diffusion Models].
* Previously, I led the AI team at [Needl.ai](https://www.needl.ai) as VP & Head of AI, where I developed large-scale information retrieval systems and generative AI solutions for finance and banking.
* Currently, I’m working on my own venture — [StockOMJ.ai](https://stockomj.ai) — where I’m building “WITY,” an AI trading assistant designed to help traders and investors make disciplined, insight-driven decisions.

I’m also reviving my [personal blog (wity’ai)](https://varun-ml.github.io) to share weekly updates on the journey of building StockOMJ, along with thoughts on AI, search, and personalization in finance.

Thank you for stopping by — I look forward to sharing more soon.
